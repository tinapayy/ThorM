# ThorM: A Machine Learning-Based Classification of Convective Storm Risk Levels Using Climatological Data in Metro Manila, Philippines

## Overview
ThorM is a machine learning-based project designed to classify convective storm risk levels using climatological data specific to Metro Manila, Philippines. By leveraging weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and others, the project predicts storm risk levels categorized into Low, Moderate, and High risk levels. ThorM aims to provide early warning and proactive decision-making for urban and disaster management.

## Objectives
- Apply and compare machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost) for storm risk classification.
- Identify key weather variables influencing storm risk levels using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning techniques.
  
## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships in climatological data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Evaluation and implementation of multiple ML algorithms, including:
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  - XGBoost
- **Visualization:** Data visualizations for better interpretability and understanding of storm risks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`
- Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab
- Climatological Dataset: Historical weather data for Quezon City, Metro Manila

## **Dataset**
The dataset for our project was sourced from Visual Crossing, which provides weather data from Quezon City spanning four years, with 1,462 entries and 33 features.
